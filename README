C++, C, D, Python -- all have re-entrant Lock support. Go - doesn't.

there are some hack Go packages, which try to get Goroutine id and use it 
to base Mutex locking on.

current package suggests the other approach to this problem, by 
creating Mutex using context in space of function call (on stack)
so Mutex locking is based on call context. this context is shared 
via function parameter.

see example usage in tests directory
